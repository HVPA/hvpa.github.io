Creating an account
Creating an account on the HVP Australian Node Portal is a little different to most account creation steps. This is to ensure that we are granting access to our data in compliance with our Data Access Policy.

Ensure that you meet the requirements of our Data Access Policy.
Visit http://portal.hvpaustralia.org.au/signup/.
Fill out your personal details.
Enter information about your organisation or institution and a person there that we can contact for verification, if we need to. This might be your laboratory or clinical director, a colleague at your practice, or someone else that knows you, your qualifications and why you want to access HVP Australian Node data.
Once your details have been submitted, you will need to wait for us to approve your account. This can take a few days, so please be patient. Once approved, you will recieve an email and will be able to log in to the Portal.

What do I do if I've forgotten my password?

Happens to everyone now and again, it's not a big deal. Just send us an email and we'll reset it for you.

Searching for variants
Once you've successfully logged in to the HVP Australian Node Portal, searching for variants is very easy. The search options are availabe via the "search" option in the left hand menu.

Clicking this button opens the Gene/Disease search view. This page allows you to search for and select the gene of interest that you want to find variants for.

Available search options here are:

Official HGNC gene name (e.g. BRCA) and alternate names recognised by the HGNC
Reference sequence accession numbers (e.g. NM_000059.3)
Disease Names (e.g. breast cancer)
Simply enter one of these terms into the search box and click the search button. You'll be presented with a list of matching gene records that you can select from. Choose the right one for you and click on the record to take you to the Variant search view.

Alternatively, rather than searching for a gene, simply pick a gene from the top 5 (by number of variants) list of gene records below the search box.

After searching for and clicking on a gene record, you'll be presented with the Variant search view. This page contains a search box for searching for specific variants: just enter the HGVS variant name or genomic coordinates and click "search." The results will be returned below the search box.

By default, this page displays all results until a search is executed to narrow the results set. The results are often spread over many pages.
