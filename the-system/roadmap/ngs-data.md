NGS Data
LOVD Prototype
LOVD3 is a recent version of the open source LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, php) stack designed at the Leiden University Medical Centre for storing and sharing genetic variant data.  This uncurated prototype version contains demonstration data only and could represent a starting point from which to build an NGS-compatible means of sharing data. However it is quite gullible: it will "believe" any VCF file that is uploaded, so we need to work out ways in which the quality of those variant calls can be marked in the upload files and flagged as "robust" (or otherwise) by the database.

VCF Format Extension Project
Although VCF files have become the de facto standard for outputting variants discovered during NGS, we have identified a shortcoming in the file format specification that limits their utility within the diagnostic context. The standard implementation of the VCF specification does not allow for the inclusion of metadata that allows the provenance of the data to be tracked or for details on how the data was generated—for example, what sequencing platform was used, what bioinformatics tools and pipelines generated the variant calls, etc.—to be included. To address these issues, the HVPA Node, through its Director, Professor Graham Taylor, has officially proposed that the extension of the VCF format to better support use in the diagnostic context be adopted as a standards development activity by the international Human Variome Project. An initial meeting exploring this issue and bringing together international stakeholders and other interested parties will be held during the annual American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Boston in October, 2013.
