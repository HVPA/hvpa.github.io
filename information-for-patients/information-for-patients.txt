Information for Patients
The results of genetic tests that are carried out in Australia will often provide valuable answers to questions about an illness or potential illness in the person being tested and their family. But these results can also be used to help provide answers for other people in Australia and around the world with similar genetic changes.

Unfortunately, although we know a great deal about the genes that cause the majority of genetic disorders, our understanding of exactly which changes to the sequence of these genes cause disease and which changes can be tolerated by the body is limited.

The DNA sequences that make up our genes contain a large amount of redundancy that makes it possible for our bodies to tolerate some changes. This means that we cannot always be sure whether or not a genetic change will affect gene function and, by extension, cause disease.

This is referred to as the “pathogenic or not” question and it underpins all genetic testing. Pathologists are required to, based on the evidence available to them, make a call on whether or not any changes they observe in a patient affect gene function.

These calls can be made more accuratley, and more efficiently, by considering prior cases from patients known to be carrying similar genetic changes. This makes the systematic collection and sharing of genetic test results a necessary step for developing our understanding of genetic illness.
