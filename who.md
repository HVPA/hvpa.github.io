## Collaborators

The Human Variome Project Australian Node is collaborating with a number of Australian and international organisations to develop and maintain its service to the Australian genetic diagnostics and research community.

###Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing
<img alt="VPAC: Infinite Innovation" src="{{site.baseurl}}img/vpac_logo.png" style="width: 193px; height: 89px; float: right;">The <a href="http://www.vpac.org/">Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing</a> is an advanced computing solution provider with its head office in Carlton South, Melbourne and is wholly Australian owned. VPAC was formed in 2000 by a consortium of Victorian Universities, and since then has grown to a staff of over 50 employees at several locations.

VPAC has a highly experienced Management team and is ISO certified for its Quality Management System. VPAC has taken lead and supporting project roles across industry, academia, and government, with interstate, national, and international engagements. Examples of major commercial customers include GM Holden, GKN Aerospace, Autoliv, Robert Bosch (Australia) and various government Departments including the Victorian Department of Primary Industries, Department of Sustainability and the Environment and Department of Justice; and DIISR at a Commonwealth level.

VPAC is recognised as a leading provider across a range of Advanced Computing technologies from IT systems management through software development and business analysis. VPAC has a successful track record of delivery of integrated systems development using open source and commercial software platforms, focused especially on agile software development and project management with evolving requirements and thus ongoing end-user engagement and consultation throughout the life-cycle of the project.

VPAC has highly experienced staff in IT services including:

- High Performance Computing and large scale data hosting
- Geospatial software development, visualisation and data processing
- Computational Engineering, computer simulations and visualisation
- Parallel CPU and GPU programming, applications performance analysis and tuning
- Virtual Engineering and systems integration
- Health informatics
- Embedded systems/Telematics and Human Machine Interface

VPAC has deep expertise in both agile and structured software development life cycle (SDLC) methods. Of the 55 full-time staff, VPAC has 38 full-time technical specialist software developers, systems analysts, web developers, multimedia specialist, geospatial specialists, computational engineers, software engineers, HPC and desktop system administrators, visualisation specialists, network and systems engineers who work in projects as required, to deliver integrated solutions to clients.

VPAC’s core business is in the design, prototyping and production implementation of large scale data intensive infrastructure projects that require aspects of High Performance Computing for complex simulations, handing of large data sets from a variety of internal and external source in various formats, and the analytics and visualisation of these data sets for the purposes of communication and decision making.

Over past 11 years, VPAC has developed and implemented in excess of 400 successful software development projects for the Health, Community/Social Services, Primary Industries, Environment, Science and Research, Geo Spatial, and Scientific and Engineering (Manufacturing) sectors. The completed projects range in size from one week, one-person projects to teams of up to seven working for 18 months. It is noteworthy that over this time VPAC has never had a major software project failure – as measured by large cost or budget overruns or project abandonment. This is all due to the quality of our staff and project management, and use of modern Agile Development methodologies. The average overall feedback rating from VPAC’s customers is 4.5 out of 5 for time, cost and quality. VPAC has won awards for our work in the AutoCRC specifically in the area of collaboration and teamwork with partner organisations in projects. Client testimonials can be released upon request.

### Advanced Computing Research Centre – University of South Australia</h2>
<a href="http://www.unisa.edu.au/Research/Advanced-Computing-Research-Centre"><img alt="University of South Australia" src="{{site.baseurl}}img/unisa_logo.png/" style="width: 252px; height: 76px; float: right;"></a> is the research concentration of the School of Computer and Information Science and related departments at University of South Australia. Semantic systems group led by professor Stumptner is active in multiple areas – both theoretical and applied research. The group has been involved in a large number of government as well as industry funded and partnered research projects including organisations such as SIEMENS, FESTO, Frequentis, Austrian Industries, GM/Holden, VPAC, DSTO, and ANSTO. These projects have led to deployed systems such as the constraint-based LAVA configurator in use at Siemens until 2001 (whose architecture was applied in the commercial ILOG Configurator). Technical systems diagnosis and debugging projects have led to a large number of successful research prototypes or deployed systems in applied knowledge representation in a variety of application areas, e.g., the VHDLDIAG debugging tool at Siemens or the WFCOMP monitoring tool internally deployed at Siemens, the AD2L and DTalk specification languages for diagnosis components, and the JADE prototype for debugging of Java programs, that constitute one of the foremost bodies of work in intelligent debugging and technical diagnosis. Results from an ARC Discovery Project on database integration are were incorporated in an integration tool being developed for the CRC CIEAM (partners ANSTO, Sunwater).

Recently the team developed a prototype of MAWSON: clinical genetic repository ( funded by Quality Use of Pathology Project, Commonwealth Dpt. Of Health and Aging)&emdash;currently tested at Flinders Medical Centre (South Australia) and Familial Cancer Service (Westmead Hospital, Westmead NSW ).

The team also developed a prototype of xTardis (collection of data and metadata for 2 instruments) currently tested at Ian Wark Research Institute, UniSA (funded by ANDS).

### Human Variome Project International Ltd
<a href="http://www.humanvariomeproject.org/"><img alt="The Human Variome Project" src="{{site.baseurl}}img/hvp_int.png" style="width: 76px; height: 76px; float: right;"></a>Human Variome Project International Ltd. (HVPI) is the international Coordinating Office for the <a href="http://www.humanvariomeproject.org/">Human Variome Project</a>—the international effort to capture, curate and share information on all genetic variation effecting human disease. The Human Variome Project develops international standards and guidelines for the collection, curation, storage and sharing of molecular and clinical data in country specific and gene/disease specific databases and is committed to seeing genetic variation data made freely and openly available to all.

### BioGrid Australia
<a href="http://www.biogrid.org.au/"><img alt="BioGrid Australia" src="{{site.baseurl}}img/biogrid.png" style="width: 145px; height: 93px; float: right;"></a> provides a flexible and secure method for interrogating the multiple data sources, where thousands of records of patient data are re-linked across all the databases and institutions. The data which is co-located in a virtual repository can be linked with publicly available research and genetic profiling data. Only authorised researchers can extract subsets of data, transform them where required and test research questions using their own analytical tools.

BioGrid Australia will be responsible for providing services to researchers for querying for results across distributed datasets.
