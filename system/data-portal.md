##HVPA Portal
The HVPA Portal is the front-end to the data in the HVPA Repository. It provides diagnostic laboratory workers, clinicians and genetic counsellors with a set of simple tools to interrogate and view the Australian Node data.

Access to the Portal is restricted to those individuals who meet the conditions outlined in our [Data Access Policy]({{site.baseurl}}data-access).

##HVPA Repository
The HVP Repository is the workhorse of the Australian Node, storing the data submitted by our participating laboratories.

##Data Hosting
The repository is currently hosted on the NeCTAR Research Cloud, a national cloud for Australian researchers. The Australian Node data is located in the Cloud Node at the University of Melbourne, spread across two physically secure facilities.
